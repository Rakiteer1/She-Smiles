From the book: Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw.

Disclaimer I am not Zed Shaw.

This is my implementation of the homework in Exercise 36.

Were the student is required to write a game similar to the one by Shaw.

For referene see page 121 of the book.

About the game.

This simple game is about a character who goes through a number of experiences.

It follows his story through anxiety, reassurance, dissappointment, betrayal by loved ones then
ultimately resolution and new purpose.

Based on the writers own experience.

Venting, therapy, and programming practice all in one activity. Oh my!
